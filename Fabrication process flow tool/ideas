### Need to have

    - labelling to state what process is occuring --> drag n drop labels, source of insp: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47700462/creating-and-moving-shapes-on-click-with-tkinter-and-canvas
    - add legend

    - A goBack() function to work on previous subwindows
    - A marker to show what subwindow you are currently working in

    - GoNext() needs to include a copy of the previous structure. Use 'storing_rectangle_info.py' for inspo.

    - colorcoding for materials




### Nice to have

    - add custom material + custom colorcoding
    - process action (i.e. arrows to show bombardment/uv exposure)



### DONE:

    - AddLayers() function that adds layers to wafer
    - A GoNext() function that goes to the next step of the process flow


### BUGS:

    - If structure becomes too tall (wafer + 3 layers) the next line gets whack. See 'BUG1.png' for example.
